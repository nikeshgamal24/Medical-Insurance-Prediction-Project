This was a comprehensive examination of estimating healthcare costs using patient data. My goal was to build models that could accurately predict what someone might pay.

Here’s how I tackled it, step-by-step:
1. Understanding the Data: 🔍 
First, I explored the data to see what it contained. I checked for any missing information, duplicate entries (and removed them), and anything that looked unusual. This helped me get the data ready.

2. Getting Data Ready (Preprocessing): 🧹 
This crucial step transformed the raw data. 
 I identified two types of features: numerical (such as age) and categorical (like gender or region).
For numbers, I used StandardScaler to make sure they were all on a similar scale. ⚖️
For categories, since they were mostly names (nominal), I used OneHotEncoder to turn them into numbers. 🔢
I built a ColumnTransformer pipeline to apply these changes consistently to both my training and testing data. ⚙️

3. Training Different Models: 🧠
 I then trained various regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and many more) on the prepared training data. The idea was to see how different algorithms would learn from the information.

4. Checking Model Performance: ✅ 
After training, I evaluated each model using metrics like R2 Score, MAE, and RMSE. I checked how well they performed on both the data they saw during training and, more importantly, on new, unseen test data. My bar plots clearly showed how each model stacked up, both on the training and test sets. 📈

5. Refining Models with Hyperparameter Tuning: 🎯
This was a key part! Sometimes models learn the training data too well and struggle with new data (overfitting). To fix this, I used RandomizedSearchCV to fine-tune algorithms like Random Forest, Decision Tree, and AdaBoost. This tuning helped reduce overfitting significantly and boosted the accuracy on the test data. It made the models more reliable for real predictions! ✨

6. Testing with Real Samples: 🧪 
Finally, I used the best-tuned models to predict charges for a few sample cases, just to see them in action.
